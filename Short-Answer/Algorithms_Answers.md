#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) I believe this algorithim is O(n) time complexity because the while loop runs while a < n * n * n times which is fixed,
and runs one operation per a


b)  in total, we will perform n times n assignments because there is a nested loop so n will scale ^ 2 so the runtime is O(n^2)


c) best case is bunnies == 0 it would be O(1) constant time...if not the function is calling itself again n times minus one so it scales linearly o(n)
